# Meteorite_Landings
 Rabia Sunger contributed to this project. This was a 2 person project.
 For this project, we created 2 collections in MongoDB. We then used Python and Flask-Pymongo to create our API's. We then used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create our webpages.
 The data set was pull from Nasa's website.https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh
 You can take a look at the screen shots for a quickview. I am working on a solutionthrough Heroku cloud platform to host this program.
 Thanks for stopping by.
