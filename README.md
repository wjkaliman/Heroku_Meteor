# Meteorite_Landings
 This project was to find a dataset, clean it up and create a database. Then, you were to create a web app that would be user driven.
 For this project, we created 2 collections in MongoDB. We then used Python and Flask-Pymongo to create our API's, used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create our webpages.
 The data set was pull from Nasa's website.https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh
